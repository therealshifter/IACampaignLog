# IACampaignLog
Tool for use with the Star Wars(tm) Imperial Assault board game. Keep a virtual log of all of your campaigns.

This tool is designed to assist host players of the Star Wars(tm) Imperial Assault board game.
Instead of using the supplied pen-and-paper campaign log at the back of the game's rulebooks,
this application can be used instead to keep a virtual log of all persistent elements of the campaign,
including Agenda cards, side missions, purchased items and class cards.
The application is supplied with some pre-loaded game resources from the core set and a select few expansions
but users are able to add to the resource lists as they acquire future expansions, including the ability to set up
campaign templates.
